<b>wild duck theories</b> offers a range of consulting services relating to the diagnosis of problems in complex IT systems, particularly IT systems that feature IBM's java-based middleware technologies such as IBM WebSphere Application Server and related products.</p>
<p>Using our tools, we can help analyse:
<ul>
  <li>application server logs</li>
  <li>apache access logs</li>
  <li>thread dumps</li>
  <li>system dumps</li>
  <li>heap dumps</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If our analysis determines that there may be an issue in a 3rd party product, we can help to isolate the fault and produce a test case that can be submitted to the product vendor.</p>
<p>Our services are available at an hourly rate which excludes travel and accommodation expenses.</p>
