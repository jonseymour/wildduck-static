<p>Development of our products is underway. Many of the products will be released under an open source license that will allow anyone to make use of the products free of charge.</p>
<p>The sorts of products we intend to develop include tools to acquire, parse, analyse, correlate, visualise, archive, transport and annotate various kinds of system log data.</p>
<p>The first wildduck theory product is a package management system for bash, called <a href="https://github.com/wildducktheories/jsh">jsh</a>.</p>
