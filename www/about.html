<b>wild duck theories</b> is the business name being used by Jon Seymour to offer problem diagnosis solutions in the form of tools and consulting services. Jon resigned from IBM in 2014 after a career spanning 24 years. The "wild duck" part of the name was inspired by a long term colleague who remarked upon hearing of Jon's decision to resign: "Oh dear! Is IBM losing its last wild duck?". "theories" signifies the value of the scientific method as the foundation of a good problem solving technique.

<p>"wild duck theories" are the theories you need to solve hard problems whose solution has eluded you. 
A good theory will help isolate faults. An excellent theory will generate predictions that can be used to anticipate recurrences of a problem ahead of time. Such predictions can help restore a sense
of control to a stressful situation. Jon's primary expertise is analysing a situation, generating theories to explain the situation and then finding ways to either prove or disprove the validity of those theories.</p>
<p>Jon's main passion, however, is writing software and, in particular, tools. He believes he has stumbled upon a virtuous cycle whereby tools he writes for fun will provide opportunties
to solve other people's hard problems and so generate income that allows him to continue writing tools. That's the plan, anyway.</p>
